# Purpose: Script takes in a text file of the geometry generated in qgis
# (or any other gis or cad package) and produces geometry files used by
# the triangle mesh generator program (i.e., it writes *.poly geometry 
# file for use in triangle mesh generator. This script is significantly
# slower than gis2triangle_kd.py, as it uses a semi brute force method
# to search for noded. This script should only be used only when 
# gis2triangle_kd.py script does not produce satisfactory results.
# 
# Revised: Feb 20, 2016
# Made it work for python 2 and 3
# 
# Revised: Nov 12, 2016
# Changed the format of the holes file from holesid,x,y to x,y.
#
# Revised: Dec 10, 2016
# Changed how the script searches for duplicate nodes. Previously a 
# duplicate node was considered one that had (x,y,z) values that were 
# identical. This meant that two nodes at the same location in (x,y) 
# space could exist, and would have two different z values. This was
# eliminated by keeping only unique (x,y) values, and assigning a z
# value to the unique nodes via KDTree search mechanism. This change
# did not cause cKDTree to crash, so it was used in the script.
#
# Uses: Python 2 or 3, Numpy
#
# Example:
#
# python gis2triangle.py -n nodes.csv -b boundary.csv -l lines.csv -o out.poly
#
# where:
#       --> -n is the file listing of all nodes (incl. embedded nodes
#                        if any). The nodes file consist of x,y,z or x,y,z,size;
#                        The size parameter is an optional input, and is used 
#                        by gmsh as an extra parameter that forces element 
#                        size around a particular node. For triangle, it has
#                        no meaning. The nodes file must be comma separated, and
#                        have no header lines. 
#
#       --> -b is the node listing of the outer boundary for the mesh.
#                        The boundary file is generated by snapping lines
#                        to the nodes from the nodes.csv file. The boundary file 
#                        consists of shapeid,x,y of all the lines in the file.
#                        Boundary has to be a closed shape, where first and last 
#                        nodes are identical. Shapeid is a integer, where the
#                        boundary is defined with a distict id (i.e., shapeid 
#                        of 0). 
#
#       --> -l is the node listing of the constraint lines for the mesh.
#                        The lines file can include open or closed polylines.
#                        The file listing has shapeid,x,y, where x,y have to 
#                        reasonable match that of the nodes.csv file. Each distinct
#                        line has to have an individual (integer) shapeid. If no 
#                        constraint lines in the mesh, enter 'none' without the
#                        quotes.
#
#       --> -h is the listing of the holes in the mesh. The holes file is
#                        generated by placing a single node marker inside a
#                        closed line constraint. The holes file must include a 
#                        x,y within the hole. If no holes (islands) in the mesh, enter 
#                        'none' without the quotes. Note that for triangle, the
#                        format of the holes file is different than for gmsh!!!
#
#      --> -o is the output triangle geometry. To generate the mesh, run:
#                        $ ./triangle out.poly 
#                        or use any one of triangle's command line switches.
# 
#      --> -d is an optional flag to ignore removal of duplicate nodes in the 
#                        nodes file. By default, duplicate nodes are removed 
#                        from the nodes.csv file.
