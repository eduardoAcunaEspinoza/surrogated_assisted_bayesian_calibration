#
# Purpose: Same inputs as gis2triangle.py; calls gis2triangle.py, then
# uses python's subprocess module to call triangle to create the tin, then calls 
# triangle2adcirc.py to produce an adcirc tin file.
#
# Modified: Feb 20, 2016
# Made it work for python 2 and 3
#
# Revised: Apr 29, 2017
# Changed how different system architectures are called; made it work
# for the raspberry pi system.
#
# Revised: May 6, 2017
# Placed a call to processor type inside the posix if statement.
#
# Uses: Python 2 or 3, Numpy
#
# Example:
#
# python gis2tin.py -n nodes.csv -b boundary.csv -l lines.csv -h none -o out.grd
#
# where:
#       --> -n is the file listing of all nodes (incl. embedded nodes
#                        if any). The nodes file consist of x,y,z or x,y,z,size;
#                        The size parameter is an optional input, and is used 
#                        by gmsh as an extra parameter that forces element 
#                        size around a particular node. For triangle, it has
#                        no meaning. The nodes file must be comma separated, and
#                        have no header lines. 
#
#       --> -b is the node listing of the outer boundary for the mesh.
#                        The boundary file is generated by snapping lines
#                        to the nodes from the nodes.csv file. The boundary file 
#                        consists of shapeid,x,y of all the lines in the file.
#                        Boundary has to be a closed shape, where first and last 
#                        nodes are identical. Shapeid is a integer, where the
#                        boundary is defined with a distict id (i.e., shapeid 
#                        of 0). 
#
#       --> -l is the node listing of the constraint lines for the mesh.
#                        The lines file can include open or closed polylines.
#                        The file listing has shapeid,x,y, where x,y have to 
#                        reasonable match that of the nodes.csv file. Each distinct
#                        line has to have an individual (integer) shapeid. If no 
#                        constraint lines in the mesh, enter 'none' without the
#                        quotes.
#
#       --> -h is the listing of the holes in the mesh. The holes file is
#                        generated by placing a single node marker inside a
#                        closed line constraint. The holes file must include a 
#                        x,y within the hole boundary. If no holes (islands) 
#                         in the mesh, enter 'none' without the quotes. Note 
#                        that for triangle, the format of the holes file is 
#                        different than for gmsh!!!
#
#      --> -o is the output adcirc file that is the TIN.
